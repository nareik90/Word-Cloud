#Object Orientated Year 4 Project 
 
 This program takes in the text from a given file. The text is then 
 analysed against a list of words that are not allowed. The accepted
 words are added to a Hash Map and the words are placed in a Java 2d display.
 The size of the words is dependent on its importance and the colour is random.
 
 
 ##Running the Program
 Navigate to the Wordie.jar file. Then run the following line of code.
	java â€“cp ./wordie.jar ie.gmit.sw.Runner
	
After this an image file is create which displays the words in a rectangle frame
in multiple colours and sizes. 

### Further improvement
Future improvments will include shadowing and random angle changes for the words. 
Incorperating an image shape would also be possible.
